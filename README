This project was developed in a Tiva C development board, ARM Cortex M4 (TM4C1294NCPDT).

There are functions that implement reading and writing to a MPU6050 IC using I2C in pins PB3 and PB2.
There's also a interrupt on pin PF1 that triggers the calibration process and two LEDs (PF0 and PF4).

After compiling and starting, the board will configure GPIOs, Interrupts, Timers and the I2C module.
Line 122 configures the data acquisition frequency from the accelerometer. Change the number argument according to desired frequency (120000000 * period).
After all configured, two LEDs (LED4 and LED3) will blink together, waiting for user input (interrupt trigger at falling edge) in pin PF1 (USER_BTN).
When pressed, it will read the accelerometer for 200 data points (calibrate_accelerometer function) and use this data to average an offset for the data.
This offset will be stored in ACCEL_OFFSET variable, for x, y and z axis.
Data should be showing on UART after the calibration.

UART Configuration:
57600 baud, 8 data btis, 1 stop bit, no parity.
